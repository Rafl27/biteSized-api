BiteSized is a platform that allows users to share stories and engage in threaded stories. To support this functionality, BiteSized requires an API that can handle stories, threads, and users.

The API should allow users to create, read, update, and delete stories and threads. It should also provide features for users to follow and unfollow other users, as well as for administrators to manage user accounts.

To ensure the security of the platform, the API should implement authentication and authorization mechanisms. Additionally, the API should be designed with scalability and performance in mind, to handle a potentially large number of concurrent requests.

Overall, the API for BiteSized should be well-documented, easy to use, and reliable, in order to provide a seamless user experience for those who use the platform.
